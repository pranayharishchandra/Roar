/* select: "_id id name parentId image", parentId is field of referenced model "Thread" and not referening model "User"

question : 
in select we can not only write the fields of the referenced model but also the fields of referencing model right, like here we are referencing parentId which is not the field of refrenced model but field of referencing model 

answer:
*Yes, you are correct. In Mongoose's populate method, the select option allows you to specify fields not only from the referenced model but also from the referencing model.
So, in the context of your code snippet, when you include parentId in the select option for the User model in the populate method of the Thread model, you are able to populate the "author" field in the children threads with the specified fields from both the User model and the Thread model.
This flexibility allows you to customize the data that gets populated into the current document based on fields from both the referenced and referencing models, providing a more versatile way to shape the populated data according to your requirements.

/*
* write model:"...." only when you need to select some fields from it to populate

Yes, you are correct. In Mongoose's populate method, the model option is used to specify the referenced model, and the select option is used to select specific fields from the referenced model. So, when you specify the model as User and include select with specific fields, you are selecting only those fields from the referenced User model.

Yes, in Mongoose's populate method, the select option allows you to specify fields not only from the referenced model but also from the referencing model. This flexibility allows you to customize the data that gets populated into the current document based on fields from both the referenced and referencing models, providing a more versatile way to shape the populated data according to your requirements.
